# Detailed Commit Documentation

## Overview

This commit implements a comprehensive version control system for the Mamba Kick game, ensuring seamless switching between v0.2 (stable) and v0.3 (development) versions while maintaining clear separation between them.

## Changes Made

### Version Structure Reorganization

1. **v0.2 (Stable Version)**
   - Relocated to `/v0.2_revert` directory
   - Fully functional with core game features
   - Enhanced with version switching capability

2. **v0.3 (Development Version)**
   - Preserved in `/v0.3_backup` directory
   - Ready for future grass feature implementation
   - Enhanced with version switching capability

### Version Switching Implementation

1. **Cross-Version Registration**
   - Modified `mainScene.ts` in v0.2 to register v0.3
   - Modified `mainScene.ts` in v0.3 to register v0.2
   - Implemented proper initialization of version manager in both versions

2. **UI Enhancements**
   - Ensured developer menu displays correct version options
   - Implemented smooth transition between versions

### Documentation

1. **Version Switching Documentation**
   - Created `VERSION_SWITCHING.md` in both version directories
   - Detailed instructions for switching between versions
   - Guidelines for future development

2. **Reversion Documentation**
   - Created `REVERSION_DOCUMENTATION.md` explaining the reversion process
   - Outlined future development plans

## Testing

- Verified that both versions can be launched independently
- Confirmed that version switching works correctly in both directions
- Ensured all core features function properly in both versions

## Future Development

- v0.2 will remain the stable version for core functionality
- v0.3 will be used for implementing the grass feature
- Additional versions can be added following the established pattern

## Technical Details

- Used TypeScript for all implementations
- Leveraged Phaser.js game framework
- Implemented singleton pattern for version management
