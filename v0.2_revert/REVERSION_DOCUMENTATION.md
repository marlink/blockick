# Codebase Reversion Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the process of reverting the codebase to the stable v0.2 version while maintaining a separate copy of v0.3 for future development.

## Reversion Process

1. **Backup of v0.3**
   - Created a backup of the v0.3 directory to preserve the grass feature implementation for future development
   - Backup location: `/Users/ciepolml/Projects/mamba-kick/v02/v0.3_backup`

2. **Restoration of v0.2**
   - Copied the v0.2 directory to a new directory named v0.2_revert
   - Copied all necessary configuration files and directories
   - Installed all dependencies using `npm install`
   - Verified the application runs correctly with `npm start`

3. **Functionality Verification**
   - Tested the dropdown menu functionality in the bottom right corner
   - Verified all core features in the demo environment
   - Confirmed the application runs without errors

## Current State

- **Active Version**: v0.2 (stable version without the grass feature)
  - Location: `/Users/ciepolml/Projects/mamba-kick/v02/v0.2_revert`
  - Status: Fully functional with all core features working properly

- **Development Version**: v0.3 (with grass feature implementation)
  - Location: `/Users/ciepolml/Projects/mamba-kick/v02/v0.3_backup`
  - Status: Preserved for future development

## Future Development Path

### Short-term Plan

1. Continue using the stable v0.2 version for production and demos
2. Address any remaining issues or bugs in the v0.2 codebase

### Long-term Plan

1. Resume development of the grass feature in the v0.3 branch
2. Implement the Atlas-based grass texture system with performance optimizations
3. Once the grass feature is stable and optimized, merge it into the main codebase

## Branch Structure

- The existing branch structure has been maintained throughout this process
- Both v0.2 and v0.3 maintain their own Git repositories
- Future development should continue to follow this structure

## Dependencies

- All project dependencies have been synchronized to match the v0.2 working state configuration
- The package.json file contains all necessary dependencies for the v0.2 version

## Notes for Developers

- When working on the v0.3 branch, refer to the optimization documentation for the grass feature
- Ensure all changes to v0.2 are also applied to v0.3 to maintain consistency
- Test all features thoroughly before merging changes between branches
